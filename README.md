# Workout Manager

## Manage your workout menu, schedule, and protein recipe!

### Who will use this app?
This is the best app for those:
- who wants to work out **regularly**
- who wants to **get big** by constantly changing menus and increasing the load
- who has lots of **protein powders**, and can't make up their mind to choose which one to drink each day

### What this application does:
- *Manage your daily workout schedule*
- *You can add menus when you think you want to do more*
- *You can change the sets, reps, or rest period for each menu if you want*
- *Also you can schedule which type of protein you want to drink each day*

### Why is this project of interest to me?
*I recently started working out at the gym, and I personally found it difficult to manage the workout menu every day. 
Therefore, I thought this app might help me work out constantly.*
